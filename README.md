### üöÄ About

A computer vision application that automatically detects and counts rice grains in images using a hybrid approach combining watershed algorithm and contour detection.

* Author: [Mushrum-mmb](https://github.com/Mushrum-mmb/)
* Framework: [gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)

### üéì Features
* Advanced Detection Algorithm:
Utilizes a hybrid approach combining watershed algorithm and contour detection to accurately identify individual rice grains even when they're touching.
* Visual Processing Pipeline:
Implements a comprehensive image processing pipeline including contrast adjustment, segmentation, noise removal, and morphological operations.
* Rice Grain Counting:
Automatically counts and labels each detected rice grain on the input image.
* Process Visualization:
Provides a visual breakdown of each step in the detection process (available in the standalone version).
* Web Interface:
Features a user-friendly Gradio web interface that allows users to upload images and get instant results.
* Device Compatibility:
Compatible with various devices and can be run locally or on Google Colab for users with low-spec computers.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
***Ensure that you have already installed Git and set up your Python environment.***

To run this application locally, ensure you have opened the CMD and have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch numpy opencv-python gradio matplotlib
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Open CMD and clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mushrum-mmb/Simple_Rice_Detection.git
```
Then cd to the clone path.
```bash
cd Rice_Grain_Detection
```

Then launch the application by running rice_detector.py.

```bash
python rice_detector.py

```
### üíª Google Colab Usage

cd Rice-Grain-Detection

### üëç How It Works

**1. Image Pre-processing:**
* Enhances image by adjusting contrast and brightness for better segmentation
* Applies color-based segmentation to separate rice from background
* Converts to grayscale for further processing
* Performs additional segmentation for better rice grain definition

**2. Noise Removal:**
* Defines morphological kernel for noise removal operations
* Applies opening to remove small noise and smoothen grain boundaries
* Uses erosion to separate touching grains

**3. Watershed Segmentation:**
* Creates sure background area by dilating the eroded image
* Uses distance transform to find the centers of foreground objects
* Thresholds to get "sure foreground" areas (central regions of grains)
* Finds unknown region (area that's not sure background or sure foreground)
* Applies marker labeling for watershed algorithm
* Implements watershed algorithm to segment touching grains

**4. Grain Counting:**
* Processes each watershed-identified grain
* Creates binary mask for current grain
* Finds contour of the grain mask
* Calculates and marks the centroid of each grain
* Applies supplementary contour detection for grains that watershed may have missed
* Combines results from both methods for accurate counting

**5. Result Visualization:**
* Shows step-by-step processing in the standalone version
* Displays final annotated image with grain count in both versions
